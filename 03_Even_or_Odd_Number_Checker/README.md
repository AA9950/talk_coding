# Ask the user to enter a number
for this one I use the input to help me find the even or odd number
Ex: print("Please enter the ever or odd number")
so this is the coding which I use for the even or odd number

# Store the number in a variable
for this question I use this functions int or input to help me solve this question
Ex:number = (int(input("Enter the number: ")))

# Use conditional statements to check if the number is even or odd
for this question I use elif or if to help me find the even or odd number
Ex:if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")
