# Add two numbers
EX: def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
This code defines a simple Python function called add_numbers 
that takes two arguments, num1 and num2, and returns their sum


# Example of how to use the function:
EX: result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)  # This will output: 8
The function is then called with the values 5 and 3, and 
the result (8) is printed to the screen
