# Check even or odd
Ex: def is_even(number):
   return number % 2 == 0
number % 2 gives the remainder when number is divided by 2
If the remainder is 0, it means the number is even
0 checks that condition and returns the result

# Example of how to use the function:
EX: result1 = is_even(4)  # This will return True
result2 = is_even(7)  # This will return False
print(result1)  # Output: True
print(result2)  # Output: False
If the function result number is even number it will
return to true, If the function result number is odd number 
it will return to false
