# Create two sets
EX: set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
made to define the two sets 

# Calculate union
EX: union = set1 | set2
print("Union:", union)
the union of two sets is a set that contains all the elements from both sets, 
without duplicates in Python, you can find the union using the operator or the union() method

# Calculate intersection
EX: intersection = set1 & set2
print("Intersection:", intersection)
the intersection of two sets is a set that contains only the elements that are present in both sets
in Python, you can find the intersection using the & operator or the intersection() method

# Calculate difference 
EX: difference = set1 - set2
print("Difference:", difference)
the difference of two sets is a set that contains elements that are in the first set but not in the second set 
in Python, you can find the difference using the - operator or the difference() method
