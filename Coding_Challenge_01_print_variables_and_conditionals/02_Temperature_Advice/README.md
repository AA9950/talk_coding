# Ask the user to enter the current temperature (in Celsius)
for this one I use the input to help me find the temperature
Ex: print("Please enter the current temperature in Celsius")
so this is the coding which I use for the temperature

# Store the temperature in a variable
for this question I use this functions int or input to help me solve this question
Ex:Temperature = (int(input("Enter the temperature: ")))

# Use conditional statements to give advice based on the temperature
for this question I use elif or if to help me find the temperature
Ex:if Temperature < 10:
    print("It's cold outside.")
    print("Wear a jacket!")
if 10<= Temperature <=25:
        print("it's a nice day.")
        print("Wear short-sleeves!")
if Temperature > 25:
    print("It's hot outside.")
    print("Stay cool!")
