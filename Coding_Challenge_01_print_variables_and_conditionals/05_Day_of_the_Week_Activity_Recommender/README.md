# Ask the user to enter the current day of the week
for this one I use the input to help me find the Day of the Week Activity Recommender
Ex: print("Please enter the current day of the week")
so this is the coding which I use for  the Day of the Week Activity Recommender

# Store the day in a variable
for this question I use this functions int or input to help me solve this question
Ex:day = (int(input("Enter the current day of the week: ")))

# Use conditional statements to recommend an activity based on the day
for this question I use elif or if to help me find the Day of the Week Activity Recommender
Ex:if day == "monday":
    print("Start your week with a workout!")
elif day == "tuesday":
    print("It's a great day to read a book!")
elif day == "wednesday":
    print("Mid-week movie night!")
elif day == "thursday":
    print("Try a new recipe!")
elif day == "friday":
    print("Relax and enjoy the weekend!")
elif day == "saturday":
    print("Go for a hike!")
elif day == "sunday":
    print("Prepare for the week ahead with some self-care.")
else:
    print("Invalid day. Please check your input.")
