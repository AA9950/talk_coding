# Ask the user to enter their score (out of 100)
for this one I use the input to help me find the score of my mark
Ex: print("Please enter your score between 0 and 100")
so this is the coding which I use for my finding score

# Store the score in a variable
for this question I use this functions int or input to help me solve this question
Ex:myScore = (int(input("Enter your grade:")))

# Use conditional statements to print the grade based on the score
for this question I use elif or if to help me find the score also help to find the grade.
Ex:if myScore >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
    print("Congratulations, you are successful")
if 80 <= myScore <= 89:
    print("Grade B")
    print("Congratulations, you are successful")
else:
    print("The score is not between 80 and 89")
if 70 <= myScore <= 79:
    print("Grade C")
    print("Congratulations, you are successful")
else:
    print("The score is not between 70 and 79")
if 60 <= myScore <= 69:
    print("Grade D")
    print("Congratulations, you are successful")
else:
    print("The score is not between 60 and 69")
if myScore < 60:
    print("Grade F")
    print("Congratulations, you are successful")
if 0 <= myScore <= 49:
    print("Fail")
    print("Fail, try again")
print("Do you need any help?ðŸ¤”")
