# Ask the user to enter their age
for this one I use the input to help me the eligible age to vote
Ex: print("Please enter your age")
so this is the coding which I use for the eligible age to vote

# Store the age in a variable
for this question I use this functions int or input to help me solve this question
Ex:age = (int(input("Enter the age: ")))

# Use conditional statements to check if the person is eligible to vote
for this question I use elif or if to help me find the eligible age to vote
Ex:if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote!")
elif age < 18:
    print("Sorry,you are not eligible to vote yet.")
