# 01 Write a program that prints numbers from `1` to `10`
for i in range(1, 11):
This loop iterates 10 times, and each time `i` takes on one value from the sequence `1, 2, 3, ..., 10`. It can be used for various purposes, such as counting, performing repeated tasks, or generating simple sequences.

# 02 Write a program that prints numbers from `1` to `10`
EX: if i % 2 == 0:
       continue
    print(i)
For odd values of `i`, the condition `i % 2 == 0` is `False`, so the `continue` statement is not executed, and `print(i)` runs
